# FraudDetection
By using machine learning classifiers predict suspicious transactions prone to money laundering on the synthetic SAML-D dataset from kaggle

## Classifiers Used
Gradient Boosting classifiers Light GBM and XG Boost
XG Boost performs better

## Balancing
Done with Oversampling(Smote) and Undersampling(RUS) the dataset.
Oversampling works better than undersampling by 5.3% giving more recall, precision and f1score
